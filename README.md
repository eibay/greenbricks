# GreenBricks

Frontend demo of my property listing called 'GreenBricks', with capability to search and view details using reactjs and redux boilerplates utilizing 'ducks' project and component based structure. Below are the features currently being implemented. 

  - Search property
  - View details of property
  - Navigation
  - Redux part testing


### Tech

Pricks uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) - Component based javasript via create-react-app boilerplate
* [redux](https://redux.js.org) - Component based javasript via create-react-app boilerplate
* [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) - Boilerplate for the react structure 
* [ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) - Redux structure guide
* [jest](https://jestjs.io/) - testing framework used in this app
* [reach-router] (https://reach.tech/router) - routing the app

### Development

Pricks requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Running Tests

```sh
$ npm test
```

### Todos

 - Write more tests
 - Display more details to show in detail page
